user input how many default max IVs are there

do you have destiny knot

input current IVs

create array of (31, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31)
while my stats is that array, randomly generate number between 0-31

randomize number between 0-31 and replace values depending if you have destiny knot or not
if the counter for # of 31's are the same, check each index to see if it's greater than the parent's ie) 31 > 0.. so replace with that

do this until you get 6 IVs

print output of how many eggs you need to hatch


list1 = [5, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31]
list2 = [5, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31]
list3 = [31, 28, 31, 31, 31, 31]

comparing each index in each list...

if perfCount(childPerfCount, ivList3) == perfCount(parent1PerfCount, ivList1)
	for i in list3:
		for j in list 2:
			for k in list 3:
				if i > j:
					list1 = list3
